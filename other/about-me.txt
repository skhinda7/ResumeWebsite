Hello! My name is Simardeep Khinda. 
I am an upcoming sophomore at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. 
I am currently working towards my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. 
Through this website, I wanted to exhbit my skills and knowledge towards front-end programming. 
I have used elements of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to complete this online portfolio. 
My current goal is to dive deeper into programming and learn not only the basics of front-end programming but also dig into frameworks and eventually, back-end developing as well.


As a demonstration of my skills, I have displayed a few special elements on the Home Page of this website. As this is my first finished HTML project, I plan to create even better pages with better design and additional functionality.
